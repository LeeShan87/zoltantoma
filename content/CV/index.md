BitNinja is an easy-to-use server security tool that can be installed on your server within a couple of minutes and requires virtually no maintenance. It is a mixture of an on-premise and cloud-based solution. It is an agent that sits on your infrastructure and sends the attack information to the central server, which is in the cloud. In addition, it has a new technology called defense network. Every BitNinja-protected server learns from each attack and shares the learned information with the central server and other BitNinja-enabled servers. Hence, the shield gets stronger and stronger with every single attack.
