### 2016-Oct 2021, - Lead Security Software Developer/Team Lead, BitNinja.io

BitNinja is an easy-to-use server security tool, which can be installed on your server within a couple of minutes and requires virtually no maintenance. It is a mixture of an on-premise and cloud-based solution. It is an agent that sits on your infrastructure and sends the attack information to the central server, which is in the cloud. In addition, it has a new technology called defense network. Every BitNinja-protected server learns from each attack and shares the learned information with the central server, and other BitNinja-enabled servers. Hence, the shield gets stronger and stronger with every single attack.

- Acted as security threat manager to identify possible attack vectors against shared hosting servers including searching and implementing (PoC) new security risk mitigation tools and creating intrusion detection rules for the log analyzer and WAF which had a full transparent proxy featuring layer 7 firewall with ModSecurity and Captcha service.
  Investigate PHP-based malware how they were made to the servers, what where effects were, and why they got passed through the countermeasures.
- Organized training sessions about new technologies brought to the company and found attack patterns for the team and the tech support.
- Implement security management scripts in the PHP-based multi-process Linux daemon application called BitNinja Linux Agent.
- Contribute to the micro-services that were backends to the Agent, like defining incident types, storing them to MongoDB, and broadcasting with RabbitMQ.
- Use the public Swagger API to interact with the services.
- Acted as DevOps Engineer to deliver stable Linux packages for CentOS, CloudLinux, Debian and Ubuntu.
- Maintained the public deb and rpm package repositories hosted on AWS
- Created a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins that transformed from a dedicated server to a multi-container builder stack in Rancher which later transformed into a docker slave builder featuring omnibus packaging
- Maintain the public documentation page generated by Sphinx delivered by Docker
- Created a development environment that helps users spin up fully virtualized environments for Agent dev in CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, CloudLinux, Kali with Vagrant, SaltStack or Ansible. The minimalist version is available on GitHub
- Created a new C4 model of the Agent stack with PlantUML on Confluence, which helps others understand how the Agent interacts with the cloud-based micro-services and protects the servers.
- Helped to create a dedicated BitNinja Linux Agent team
- Consulted with stakeholders and other team leaders
- Assigned team tasks and review code changes
