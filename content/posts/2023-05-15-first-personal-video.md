## Script?

Hi all, curious minds, and welcome to my personal channel. 

There are a lot of things I want to talk about, but I had a problem. Where should I upload it?

And the feedback to it was like:
- It doesn't fit your niche.
- How are you going to brand it?
- How are these things even connected?
- And the list can go on.

My answer to these:

These are my shiny objects. My mistakes, my interests. 

## Thoughts

I was a bit nervous when I pressed the record button once again.

I have a completely new setup. And I wasn't able to try it out previously.

Yeah, I know It will be a looong road ahead till I can feel I'm satisfied with my productions. But the most challenging part every time is to sit down and press that button.
