## Script

Hi, all curious minds. 

Today I want to talk about a bit about personal marketing. Now I'm between two jobs or contracts. But finding a new opportunity is never an easy task. I have plenty of experience, but how can I show it to HR or a company that I have them? 

---

You can add working experience to your CV; you may add your projects. But as a backend or security professional, when you are not allowed to share internal-only code fragments, this can be a difficult task.

---

In the past couple of weeks, I've been contacted by a recruiter, and the contract sounds interesting. The hiring process is very simple.
1. Can you speak and write in English?
2. You need to solve a test task.
3. You need to talk with the team.

---

Sound simple enough. But I was praying that the test should not be a HackerRank test. Please no. But it was.

---

Let's have a look at [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com).

---

It has a lot of great features, and if I want to learn a new language with minimal effort to do so, it is a great platform. 

---
Buuut, if you were working on more complex projects, then solving the "simple" algorithmic problem can feel like a waste of time. It won't give you satisfaction, and the skills required to solve these puzzles are probably not enough for an actual project.

---

And this is where personal marketing comes into place. 
Your HackerRank profile can be viewed by recruiters and future colleges.
More places you can share what you are capable of, the more opportunity you will have.

---

I need to solve this or similar tests in the future, but it will not be challenging enough for me to do so. This is why I figured out a challenge for myself. 

I will try to convert my HackerRank journey into a project I could work on.

First of let's see If we can find HackerRank Projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=hackerrank+&type=repositories).

## Thoughts

If I had not figured out how to make solving problems on HackerRank more interesting, I would never take any tests on it. But creating an open-source project about it and documenting my process via youtube videos, I hope, it will make it more exciting. 

My journey began. My HackerRank profile was established. You may want to check it out at https://www.hackerrank.com/zoltantoma87.

The first two videos about it are now available on my personal Youtube channel.

And I also created a playlist for it.

There are still more todos left around this concept. I will create thumbnails and descriptions for the videos later this week.
