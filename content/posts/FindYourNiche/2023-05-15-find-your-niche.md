## Script?

---
Youtube is a great place for sharing content. Showing your progress. Learn new interesting knowledge or just chill out.

And even you can make a living out of it. There are various ways you can earn through a video. And most of them are somehow connected to building an audience.

A very bad piece of advice I received when I tried to build my youtube carrier was: Find your niche.

---
What is niche?

- A situation or activity specially suited to a person's interests, abilities, or nature.
- Or as a business point of view: A niche market is a segment of a larger market that can be defined by its own unique needs, preferences, or identity that makes it different from the market at large. For example, within the market for women's shoes are many different segments or niches

I found these "definitions" on Google.

---

What is the problem with it, you may ask?
I have lots of fields of interest. How should I pick one?

---
When you are new to youtube... Like I am, You signup and thinking about creating your first channel. 
- How should I call it?
- How should the branding look like?
- What should I upload to it...
- And many other questions.

And if you are a little like me, you may get overwhelmed with these undecided tasks.

---
Well, you don't need to decide right the way. You can create multiple channels, and you can play with it. 

And I will show you how.

This way, you can experiment with different topics. 
And if You feel comfortable pressing the record button, you can add more "features" to your videos, like thumbnails, cuttings, and video effects.

And if you find a topic comfortable for you, then maybe you have found your niche after all.

## Thoughts

Well, I'm not good at writing scripts for videos I'm about to shoot. And also, how should I use it as a cheat sheet during filming?

For this, I found [Advanced Slides](https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides) Obsidian plugin. This is why you can see the vertical dashes during the script.

If you also find it helpful, consider supporting [MSzturc](https://github.com/MSzturc) for his work.
