I have recently quit my job as a developer because I felt overwhelmed. This pandemic made us isolated and everybody tried to reach me whenever they could. This includes my family, my former colleges, customer, and guys from to support. My job was exciting. Protect the internet and save the servers. It always had room for new things to learn and overcome challenges. But it also was stressful. With one faulty release I could potentially break hundreds of servers and by that thousands of websites could go down.

At one point I have lost myself and the negative thought kept flowing in my mind. I have lost almost every social contact that I had. I needed a change and I had to escape from anybody who had a bad influence on me. So I decided to quit. Quit from work. Quit from chats. Quit being a part of my family. And do nothing else just play Fallout 4 for a month.

How I feel that I can be productive again, but I have too many options to choose from.

I thought I should continue with my study for the OSCP exam, because of that I whole have a degree that I am an expert in cyber security. I could be a reflection of what I was doing over these years.

I could probably practice my English because I didn't use it for a long time. And if I choose to have a new job I would probably look for an international company. Or if I start my own company I probably have to speak to my customers in English as well.

I should continue my project on Github which is about asynchronous testing for PHP. It can help developers that are stuck with a legacy system without proper test suites and constantly find themselves in a situation where a bug-free release is kind of a miracle. I could probably go with the Github sponsorship as well, but how does one get notified about my work?

I could make some video tutorials about BitNinja. I know every ins and outs of the system. I was one of those who designed it after all. And there are some things that folks don't get about it. I could probably teach it. Or upload it to a site like Udemy or Skillshare.

And it all led to chaos. One day I was trying to create my development environment for creating my Packagist plugins. The other day I was learning ethical hacking. On the third, I tried to improve my English skills and in the end, I couldn't show up anything that could be valuable.

I finally found Austin Kleon's Show your work audiobook after watching [Ali Abdaal's](https://www.youtube.com/c/aliabdaal) video about it. And I keep listening to it while I'm walking. I had to realize that yes it does not have any value if I keep learning. It has no value if I keep my knowledge.

But if I document my learning process it can help others. If I share the things that I already know it can be content. It can be a place for my portfolio. It could replace my CV. Or help me to find people who have similar interests. But how can I start it?

First I need to overcome my fears of being a phony and my fear of being stupid. This is why I tried to make some Youtube videos. It also gave me other benefits but it going to be another post.

Second I need a website where I can share my experience. Because nowadays everybody has a website and it has huge benefits.

Third I need to start sharing my process without judging the outcome.

So this is what this post is about. Just start sharing your experience and your work with the world. I'm doing it right now.
