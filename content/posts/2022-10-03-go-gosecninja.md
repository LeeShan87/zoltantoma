It's been quite a long time since I published anything. One of the reasons is I've lost my spark. I had a lot of topics and experience in cyber security, but I have lost the source where I could find up-to-date information about the trending attacks. So I've decided to get more experience with Kubernetes and with Go development because I wanted to create my own little SIEM/SOC/Malware lab servers. Still, most of the time, I was on the client side, where I needed to collect logs, analyze malware and find out where and how they got through on the IDS/IPS.

I've joined a new company and an awesome team responsible for monitoring and measuring application performance for thousands of servers and applications. The code was written in Go, some clients use Kubernetes, and I had some security-related tasks over the time. But this was not enough for me. I still want to make the internet a better safer place, but I'm not able to do it. On my own at least.

I believe in open source and the power of communities that share the same goal. And I started my journey to find like-minded people who can help me to achieve this goal. I think the next language of cyber security will be Go. And security should be available to everyone. And I have found a lot of great projects, talks, communities, and my list keeps growing. Now I want to talk about them, help them, and if I can contribute to their projects wherever and whatever form I'm able to.

This is how the idea of GoSecNinja was born. It's not about my experience, It's not about my opinion. It's about helping others find fantastic open source projects, mentors, founds, and help.

How I need time and support as well to help you guys. To achieve this, I rebrand my Youtube channel to [GoSecNinja](https://www.youtube.com/@gosecninja). I've created a new [GitHub organization](https://github.com/gosecninja) where we could create projects that could help improve the internet. And a new website for this project at https://gosec.ninja/.

I am not good at frontend, and my English is improved a lot (Thank you John), but not as perfect as I want it to be. But I'll do my best.

In the foreword a couple of projects I really want to contribute to:
- https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza
- https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec
- https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy
- https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent

And now Go Security Ninjas! Let's make the internet safer together.
