## Findable

In the last couple of months, I have been working hard to make myself findable. The results of this are:
- I have this site. My Personal site of my shiny objects. (I have a story about why I refer to it like this)
- My Personal YouTube channel, which I try not to promote intensively... yet.
- A professional website, GoSecNinja. Well, I need to work on it in the future.
- And a YouTube channel for GoSecNinja, where I try to help the open-source community make the internet safer.

## Hireable

I made efforts to make myself hireable. There are many Tax-related issues if you want to work on exciting projects around the world. The basic approach to this is you need to relocate to the given country. Well, at least one would like to hire me as an employee.

To solve this issue, I have:
- Solopreneur / Sole Proprietor to cover my personal needs
- I have an Estonian company that can support many more options, which I thought impossible before.

## Connectable

I made some effort to make myself connectable. I have multiple email addresses. I have my CV online, which also contains some ways how someone reaches out to me. But I have to admit, I'm not good at social activities. I'm working on it. :) (Small steps at a time.)

## Supportable

I have many topics I want to talk about and many projects I want to participate in. But If I don't give an opportunity to make myself supportable, then I probably miss a lot of chances.

There are a lot of ways on my list, but today I made huge progress. I've signed up to [Amazon Associates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com). This may not sound like a big deal to many, but for an IT guy who basically only wants to solve problems and not worry about business stuff like marketing, hiring, taxing, customer finding, and serving, this is a whole different dimension.

## Sticky note of success

Some time ago, I introduced Scrumban to my personal life. If you haven't heard this term, don't be surprised. I made it up. It is a combination of Scrum and Kanban, the way I try to organize my todos and collaborate with my family. This note is special; this is the last cover page of my first block of sticky notes.

(I know my handwriting is awful, and my grammar is even more terrible when I try to write.  Don't judge it. :))

And I'm done with it.

## My first affiliate links

So great, I can create affiliate links, but which one should I create first? Recently I listened to Mo Gawdat's work. I will create a dedicated section for these kinds of content on my blog, but for now, here it goes:

### Scary Smart: The Future of Artificial Intelligence

The exponential development of AI will impact all of our lives. I can already feel it, and kind of scares me. This book has two parts. The first one shows you what can go wrong, and the second shows you our opportunities. Personally, I felt happy after listening to it. The Scifact game brought me hope and excitement for the future. 
Roby, if you are reading this, I hope we can learn from each other. :)
