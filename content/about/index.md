I'm a huge fan of open source, and my passion is to make the internet a safer place.

Currently looking for projects that:

- Aims to solve a security problem. Like collecting logs, correlating them with other events, shares the learned information with the correct parties.
- Open source or open code. We all make mistakes, but the community can help us to resolve them faster.
- Written in Go. It can be deployed almost anywhere.

When I find similar projects I share them with you on my:
