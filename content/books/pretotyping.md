I can't recall when I first read this book, but it changed how I think about product development.

Maybe in the future, I will add more details to this description, but for now, the takeaway is:

- Is there a quick and cheap way you can test out a theory?
- Pretotyping is ways before then prototyping. Pretotype: no pruduct. Prototype: Minimal Viable Product
